What is Jenkins and its uses?

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language.

It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

It manages and controls several stages of the software delivery process, including build, documentation, automated testing, packaging, and static code analysis. 

Jenkins is a highly popular DevOps tool used by thousands of development teams.

The Jenkins project was started in 2004 (originally called Hudson) by Kohsuke Kawaguchi, while he worked for Sun Microsystems. 

Kohsuke was a developer at Sun and got tired of incurring the wrath of his team every time his code broke the build.
